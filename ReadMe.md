## Bus Ticket Booking Application 
Bus Ticket Application is an android application that enables people to book cross-country bus travels online. They can use this app
to choose travel routes(origin and destination), travel date and other information to check on the available transports. It also enables them to pay for the ticket using an online payment gateway known as YenePay.

## Tools Used
The app is built using android studio(with Java), and for backend API I used PHP. The request and response to the API is built using Volley android library.
